# Ishii_etal_2020_behavioral_feature_analysis
This repository contains code that analyzes what a fly is doing before and after a lunge. We analyzed transitions between behavior bouts and compared behavioral transition patterns (also called ethograms) across different types of flies. The main MATLAB program for behavior transition analysis is `visualize_apply_behav_label.m`. 

The repository also includes some kinematic analysis, e.g. visualizing feature distributions and their temporal changes at fixed time points near known lunge timestamps.

The code in this repository was used to conduct analysis and draw figures in the section "nvy controls a behavioral transition leading to lunges" of the paper

Kenichi Ishii et.al. (2022). A neurogenetic mechanism of experience-dependent suppression of aggression. 

Further details of the code are described in Materials and Methods > Behavioral transition analysis section of the paper.
